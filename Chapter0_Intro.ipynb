    "ROS-Industrial is a project which main goal is to bring ROS closer to the robotics industrial world. At this point, ROS is a already a massive tool for roboticists all around the world, but it is mostly used by Research Centers and Univerisites, or for Service Robots Companies. The industrial robotics world has been the hardest area to access, mainly because they usually work with closed-loop motions, based on tasks that are very repetitive and mecanized. Anyways, the industrial world has lately become more interested in performing more complex and dynamic tasks, making their robots more intelligent."

It is important to note that it is an open-sourced project, because this means that anyone can develop and test applications for different robots (from individual users, like you and me, to Universities or Research Labs), which will at the end benefit the industrial sector."
