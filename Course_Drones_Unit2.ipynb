    "The main things we will need to do here are to be able to localize the robot within an unknown environment, and to be able to move it by it sending goals; and all of this just by using its own sensors. To do this, we'll need to solve the Simultaenous Localization and Mapping issue, which is a well-known problem in robotics, and was already treated in the Navigation Course. Now, though, we are going to use a different approach to solve this problem, which is called Parallel Tracking and Mapping (PTAM). This approach is an implementation of Monocular SLAM, and was developed by Georg Kein and David Murray. You can get more information on this subject by clicking the following link:\n",

    "The approach we're going to see in this unit basically consists of three major components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) **Monocular SLAM**: For monocular SLAM, our solution is based on Parallel Tracking and Mapping (PTAM). After map initialization, we rotate the visual map such that the xy-plane corresponds to the horizontal plane according to the accelerometer data, and scale it such that the average keypoint depth is 1. Throughout tracking, the scale of the map λ ∈ R is estimated using a novel method described in Section IV-A. Furthermore, we use the pose estimates from the EKF to identify and reject falsely-tracked frames.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) **Extended Kalman Filter**: In order to fuse all available data, we employ an extended Kalman filter (EKF). We derived and calibrated a full motion model of the quadrocopter’s flight dynamics and reaction to control commands, which we will describe in more detail in Section IV-B. This EKF is also used to compensate for the different time delays in the system, arising from wireless LAN communication and computationally complex visual tracking.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) **PID Control**: Based on the position and velocity estimates from the EKF at t +∆tcontrol, we apply PID control to steer the quadrocopter towards the desired goal location in a global coordinate system. According to the stated estimate, we rotate the generated control commands to the robot-centric coordinate system and send them to the quadrocopter. For each of the four degrees-of-freedom, we employ a separate PID controller for which we experimentally determined suitable controller gains."
