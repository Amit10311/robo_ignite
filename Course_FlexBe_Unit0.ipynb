Based on basic capabilities, which interface standard functionality, you can easily compose state machines using the drag and drop editor that FlexBe provides in its GUI. Afterwards, using the same GUI, you can execute and monitor those state machines. Also, based on the concept of collaborative autonomy, the operator is able to influence the execution during runtime, for instance, by forcing transitions. The robot can also request help or confirmation from the operator, if required, in order to execute a transition. Even complete modification of the behavior's structure is possible during runtime."
