In the new state we are going to add to our behavior, though, we are going to be using another kind of FlexBe proxy: the **ProxyActionClient**.

The interface is designed for long-term (longer than one update cycle) actions, as it is non-blocking and optionally provides feedback while being executed. This makes it a perfect interface to be used along with FlexBe, and it is recommended to base your states on action interfaces whenever they do something more complex than just subscribing to a topic."
