    "* Create the mapping launches, and map the simple wooden structure. You have to finish with a clean map of that structure and specially have mapped the way out.\n",
    "* Set up the move base system so that you can publish a goal to move_base outside the structure and SummitXL can get out of the structure by itself. This can be quite chalenging because you will have to tweek the parameters of the costmaps to move around narrow spaces.\n",
    "* Setup the launch to be able to localise the SummitXL only with GPS, odometry and IMU data. For this you will have to convert the GPS data into XY, publish this data into TF and also publish the TF of the map frame.\n",
    "* Create a program that allows the SummitXL navigate outdoors only by giving it GPS coordinates. For that you will have to create a program that publishes into the movebase action server. Bare in mind that you will also have to convert the latitude and longitude to normal XY space.\n",
    "* Create a program that when it detects a person, it publishes the GPS location into a topic called **/intruders**. The detections have to be a combination of leg detection through lasers and image recognition. The topic of **/intruders** will have GPS position of detection and reliability index of that detection.\n",
    "* Finaly, create a global program that combines all prior. This means that it will have to be able to change from map navigation to GPS navigation based on its location. It will also have to be able to move following a circuit. If a human detection is made it has to notify it and change of circuit."
