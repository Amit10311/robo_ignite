    "<a href=\"https://twitter.com/alonsorobots\">Alonso Martinez,</a> a worker at <a href=\"https://www.pixar.com/#home-cars3\">Pixar</a>. It's designed to demonstrate that with very simple elements, you can give life to a robot, as only Pixar people know how. The physical version can play Peekaboo with humans by using facial recognition through its single camera. It has a very ingenious roll, pitch, and yaw movement system. You will know how to create this simulation when you finish this course and do facial recognition with it, if you so desire.<br>\n",

In this case, it's a movement study robot based on the bouncing ball animation exercise. This simulation has been changed from the original, giving more freedom to its three legs.

    "<a href=\"https://twitter.com/alonsorobots\">Alonso Martinez</a> for his amazing robots. We decided to create a simulated version of them in this course because they are so simple and yet so rich in their abilities and expressions that we couldn't resist. They are a perfect example of the simplicity in design that makes the teaching of URDF structure so much simpler. We loved them from the first time we set eyes on them. You can see a full video where <a href=\"https://twitter.com/alonsorobots\">Alonso Martinez</a> shows them on the great <a href=\"https://youtu.be/0vfuOW1tsX0\">Tested YouTube channel</a>. Highly advisable if you want to feel inspired to create your own robots.\n",

    "<li>Thanks also to <a href=\"https://www.jibo.com/about-us\">JiboTeam</a> for creating this amazing robot that we are using as a model to teach you URDF creation.They have created an <a href=\"https://developers.jibo.com/\">SDK</a> to program the physical robot, so don't hesitate to give it a try if you are into SocialRobotics.</li>\n",
