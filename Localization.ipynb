When the robot observes the environment it's in (via sensor readings), it discards particles that don't match with these readings, and generates more particles close to those that look more probable. This way, in the end, most of the particles will converge in the most probable pose that the robot is in. So **the more you move, the more data you'll get from your sensors, hence the localization will be more precise**.
