    "A transform specifies how data expressed in a frame can be transformed into a different frame. For instance, if you detect an obstacle with the laser at 3 cm in the front, this means that it is 3 cm from the laser, but not from the center of the robot (that is usually called the **<i>/base_link</i>**). To know the distance from the center of the robot, you need to **<i>transform</i> the 3 cm from the <i>/laser_frame</i> to the <i>/base_link</i>** frame (which is actually what the Path Planning system needs to know, what is the distance from the center of the robot to the obstacle).\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't you think so? If we don't provide this information to the robot, when the laser detects an object, how can the robot know where this object is? Is it in front of the robot? Is it behind? Is it to the right? There's no way the robot can know it if we don't tell the robot the **POSITION and the ORIENTATION** of the laser regarding to the center of the robot. In order to do this, we need to do the following:\n",

    "First, we'll define two frames (coordinate frames), one at the center of the laser and another one at the center of the robot.

That's why we were moving the robot around, to publish the data that the robot was getting in real-time while moving. But if we just need some data being published on those topics... doesn't it come to your mind another obvious way of creating a map? That's right!
