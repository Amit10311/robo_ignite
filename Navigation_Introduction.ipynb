The series of ROS packages created to make possible navigation on a robot is called the **ROS navigation stack**. This book is about it, **how to make it work on a wheeled robot equipped with a laser scan**."

This is by far the most complicated part of the course and that is why you will need three days to get it right. This part, builds on the previous two and add a ton of new concepts and configurations. You will use the previous map created on day 1 and you will have to make the robot localize in that map as learnt in day 2. On top of that, you will have to configure the **move_base** system that is the one that actually makes the robot move.\n"
