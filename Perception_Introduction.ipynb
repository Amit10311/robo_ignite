In order to have a good perception system, robots need to have two things: the proper sensors and the good algorithms to make sense of the sensed :-). This book is about how to make the robot perceive the world **on a robot equipped with laser scan, camera and point cloud device**. Those are the most common and basic sensors available for robots, and we are going to use them for perception."
